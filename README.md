# projectionist

I am a long time user of vim and the marvelous plugin from Tim Pope.
I started using [vim-projectionist](https://github.com/tpope/vim-projectionist)
some times ago and found it immemsively useful to navigate a project and
even discover the arganisation of files inside the project.

Since I am currently trying hard to transition to Plan9 ports ACME editor
I did not want to loose the functionality of projectionist. I dicided to
make a rough rewrite of projectionist to golang and create the commands
that would make possible to use the `.projections.json` files from
ACME
